- ### The Gaming Backlog Tracker is a gaming app that helps gamers manage and keep track of the games they are playing and those they plan to play in the future. The app is designed to help gamers organize their gaming backlog, which is a list of games they own but have not yet completed. The idea for the app came from the common problem that myself and many other gamers face: having too many games and not enough time to play them all, and this can lead to a backlog of games that can be overwhelming to manage, and many gamers struggle to keep track of which games they are currently playing, which games they plan to play next, and which they have completed. With Backlog Tracker, gamers can easily add to their backlog and track their progress as they play. The app provides detailed information about each game, including the title, platform, genre, time played, ESRB rating and completion status. Gamers can also add notes and comments about each game, such as their personal review or thoughts about the game as they play. Overall, Backlog Tracker is a valuable tool for any gamer looking to stay organized and motivated while managing their gaming backlog.
